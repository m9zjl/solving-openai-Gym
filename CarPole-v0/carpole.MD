# carpole methods
## there are many alghrythom that can sove RL problems, and I`ll try as many as possiable
 1. random guessing & hill climbing
   - random guess and hill climbing is alike, they bose using random policy to
  init our agent, the difference between random ugess and hill climbing is,
     - random guess using random choose to update parameters
     - hill climbing using current parameter + random noise to update parameters

   and the hill climbing agent show how to train the cartpole agent using hill climbing algorythm
